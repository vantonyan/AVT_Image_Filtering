This Program is using AVT algorithm to filter images.

AVT algorithm can be used to enhance image by reducing noise. Alternatively the AVT algorithm can be used to detect picture anomalies, detecting when picture is altered.

As an example you can run the AVT filter on included Jupiter.png image and get four images named Filt_JupiterXX.png.

To do that you will need to run following python script on windows computer:

C:\python AVT_filter.py Jupiter.png

The result of this experiment is most telling in Filt_01Jupiter.png image, where it is obvious that someone messed up/enhanced mid section of this image.
